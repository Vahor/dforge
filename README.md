# DTools 

## Goals

- [x] Parse socket events
  - Note: Some bugs but ok
- [ ] Chat tabs based on regex
- [ ] Option to make chat tabs persistant (keep history)
- [ ] Kamas per session (⬆️ sell, ⬇️  buy)
- [ ] History for kamas per session (maybe graph for weeks)

**Note:**
I'm not going to make a bot or any similar tool.
This tool is just an excuse to join two things I love, Dofus and development.
I do not own any aspect of the game.
