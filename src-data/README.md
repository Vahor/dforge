# Extract socket information for Dofus

The goal here is to extract a mapping so that we can say : `if I receive id: 1, this correspond to the action X`

## Implementation

I wanted to do it myself but I found [Datafus](https://github.com/bot4dofus/Datafus/tree/master) wich goal is exactly this. 
So we can download the zip files and use them in our project.

To download the latest data, use the script
```sh
./download.sh
```
